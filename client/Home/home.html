        <h3>What is clas.si?</h3>
        <p>Clas.si is a task management or planner application for students.</p>
        <p>Many task management apps like Google Reminders or Wunderlist aren't exactly built with the student in mind. clas.si was.</p>
        <p>From the ground up, clas.si was built with all of the frustrations I've had as a student in mind:
          <ul>
            <li>Filling in a lot of redundant information over like class names, professors, etc.</li>
            <li>If I do find a nice task management app, often times it's not cross platform</li>
            <li>If I want to communicate with a study group, I have to switch from one app to the other: often times, all of my groups are on different platforms so I have to download multiple apps just to get through the school day</li>
            <li>If there are features that I want, there's no way to get them without just wishing for the developers to put them in</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>clas.si fixes that.</p>

        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>The first thing you'll be adding to your clas.si account are classes. Simply go to the Classes tab on the bottom or the left hand side and click "New Class"</p>
        <p>From there you can add the class Name, the professor, his contact info, its meeting days, when the homework is typically due, and study group members</p>
        <p>The great thing about the way clas.si is setup is that if you set up a class or a friend sets up a class, you won't have to set it up yourself. Once you get added to the class you'll automatically see it in the class list</p>
        <p>Under each class you can add tasks as well. We'll talk about this a bit later</p>
        <p>You can quickly access your study group or email your professor as well, without having to dig through a syllabus just to find his email address</p>

        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>What's a task manager if it doesn't help manage your tasks?</p>
        <p>When creating a task, the class it belongs to will automatically be filled in for you. All you have to specify is the due date and if it's a high priority assignment</p>
        <p>High priority assignments are colored blue to let you quickly and easily find them in your list</p>
